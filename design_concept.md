# Design concept and file Structure of the AGSC GitHub page
The design of the AGSC GitHub organization page was inspired by the Wellcome Connecting Science
(WCS) GitHub course [page](https://github.com/WCSCourses). The main difference between the two designs
is that the WCS runs different courses each year while the AGSC is a single course run each year. What 
this changes in the GitHub design is the file structure. 

In the AGSC, each course directory represents an iteration of the course indicated by the year it was
run in. This also means the organization landing page doubles as the landing page for all the iterations 
as oppsed to the WCS which hosts a separate landing page for each course.

## Content of each course iteration
Each course iteration is named AGSC\_year (e.g. AGSC\_2025).

Below is the file structure of each iteration directory.
```

```
- **data**: folder which contains all relevant data needed to run
that iteration. This is all datasets essential for practical exercises and aby supplementary data. For
